## Recommendations
1. Regularly test certificate rotation
2. Monitor certificate expiration dates
3. Keep secure backups of certificates
4. Verify web interface accessibility after changes

## Next Steps
1. Set up automated certificate renewal
2. Configure monitoring for certificate expiration
3. Implement automated backups
4. Document recovery procedures
